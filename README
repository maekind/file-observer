	- -p, --path: Full path to watch for changes.

### Running the docker

In order to watch to a system folder, it has to be mapped with "-v" docker option.

Here-below there is an example that maps "/srv/folder" local folder to "/srv/folder" running image folder to watch for changes recursively:

	$> docker run -ti -v /srv/folder:/srv/folder maekind/file-observer:latest -p /srv/folder -r True
## Further options

In further implementations of the file-observer, extra arguments will be added in order to enable several possibilities for communicating event changes:

a) Log event handler: change events will be logged into the python logger handler.

b) Web service handler: change events will be sent to a web service application (ip:port).
